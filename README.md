Repo for Appfolio Senior Capstone Project 2018-2019

# Cole Margerum - Team Lead
This was the project that my team and I made for our Senior Capstone class. It is written in both ReactNative and Swift. The project enables an inhanced interior design experience by letting users place 3D objects using ARKit on iOS. It also incorporates Shared Experiences, which let us have multiple users in the same location design a room together. When multiple users are in the same location, their devices will automatically connect to each other over either Bluetooth or Wifi, using the MultipeerConnectivity library. After connecting, users can use the app the same way they would alone. And as objects are placed, moved, rotated, and removed by a user, the changes made are instantly reflected on all of the connected devices. 

##### This app is still incomplete, and the UI is best on iPad
